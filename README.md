# TeamTreehouse-Full-Stack-JavaScript
Full stack JavaScript developers are highly in-demand. They know how to work with the frontend, backend, and server side of a web application—the "full stack"—via JavaScript.  JavaScript powers the interactivity and user experience on every major website. From user interfaces that provide richer desktop-like experiences to real-time data and messaging applications, you'll find JavaScript in the browser, on your phone, and on the server.  Full stack JavaScript developers working with different frameworks, libraries and languages will know how to use JavaScript in nearly every facet of their work.  In this track, we'll introduce you to the JavaScript language, and the ins-and-outs of adding interactivity in the browser.  Once you're up to speed with JavaScript in the browser, you'll learn Node.js, a popular JavaScript platform for writing and using JavaScript applications outside of the browser. For example, command line applications for improving your workflow, dynamic websites, and much more.
