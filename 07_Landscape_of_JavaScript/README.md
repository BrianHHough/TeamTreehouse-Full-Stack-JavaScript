# JavaScript as a Cross-Platform Language
Although originally designed to run in the browser, JavaScript is now a cross-platform language. Once you understand the basics, you can begin to work with JavaScript in all sorts of fascinating ways!


# JavaScript: How It All Began
- Start in 1995 - internet becoming popular but the web was static (you couldn't program web-pages...so pages were text-heavy...rarely with images or it was super basic)
- Netscape Communications - created Netscape Navigator - the first web browser (it was a hit)
- Marc Andreessen wanted the web to be livelier -- thought HTML needed a scripting programming language that could run natively in the browser and add functionality to a website (i.e. respond to user input and be useable by anyone)
- Brendan Eich - recruited by Netscape to add Scheme to Netscape Navigator...but got pulled into making a new programming language Mocha (the early name for JavaScript)...changed to LiveScript...then changed to JavaScript given the popularity of Java (but nothing in common other than being programming languages)

# The Evolution of JavaScript
JavaScript has evolved into a powerful, robust programming language. In this video, you'll more about how the JavaScript language and its standards evolved into their current state.

- 1995: Once JS launched in Netscape Navigator 2.0 - was an instant success
    - this bred a lot of competition:
    - Microsoft wanted a scripting language for their Internet Explorer --> JScript
    - These competiting technologies meant they were incompatible with each other's browswers
    - Ensuring a site could exist in both browsers was difficult, time-consuming, expensive, exhaustive
    - JS was considered a road-block (b/c it wasn't standard)
- 1996: Netscape wanted to standardize JS -- submitted it to the standards organization, ECMA International for consideration as an industry standard
    - ECMAScript became official name for verions of langauge 
    - JS standardized under a technical committee known as Ecma TC39 
    - Opens JS to a much wider audience and allow other elementors a voice into the evolution of the language 
- 1997: First verison of ECMAScript released
- 1998: ECMAScript 2 and 3 standardized + introduce new features to the langugage
- 2003 ECMAScript 4 - the committee couldn't agree on a feature set...and causes a standstill. TC39 broke up 
- For years...no major changes to the language
- 2008: TC39 committee re-groups to work on ECMA SCript 3.1 (renamed to ECMAScript 5)
    - new features included support for: JSON + Getters, Setters, and Objects + new array methods like filter(), forEach(), map().
- 2015 (June) - release of ES6: largest upgrade to the language -- officially became known as ECMASCript 2015 or ES2015.
- Today: the Ecma TC39 committee still presides over the language - delegates from browser venders (Netflix, Paypal, etc.) - can approve/deny additions



# The Different Flavors of JavaScript

### Vanilla, Plain, or Pure JavaScript
**["Vanilla, Plain, or Pure" JavaScript:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#Versions)** The use of JavaScript without any frameworks or libraries. In other words, native, standards-based JavaScript.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
    - ECMAScript 5 (ES5)
    - ES6 / ES2015

- As of 2016, a new version of **ECMAScript** gets released every year with any features ready at that time.
    - ES2016, ES2017, ESNext

There are also other non-plain versions

### Type Checkers for JavaScript
- **[TypeScript:](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** developed by Microsoft - superset of JS - layer around JS that has extra features and syntax + latest support for newest features.
    - a browswer can't understand a TS file...so it has to be translated/compiled to standard JS
- **[Flow:](https://flow.org/)** developed by Facebook - open source type checking library that makes developing apps more maintainable and performs air-checking to make it harder to intro bugs into your code + gives you real time information on your code
- **[CoffeeScript:](http://coffeescript.org/)** simple and adds syntaxtical sugar to your code - not understood by browsers, so it gets reduced to JS 
- **[Dart:](https://www.dartlang.org/)** object oriented programming language developed by Google - to create complex and highly scalable apps for the web, mobile apps, and IoT devices



# jQuery, a JavaScript Library
jQuery is a JavaScript library used to add interactivity to web pages. It's a commonly used tool found in tens of millions of sites and apps all over the web and popular front-end frameworks.

Even if you don't end up using jQuery in your personal or professional projects, it's worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with its syntax, documentation, and some of its basic techniques. Doing so can provide a richer understanding of interacting with the DOM and web development in general.

You never know when you may encounter jQuery while working on a project or with a framework that the client or your team wants to use. And it's a prevalent item in the list of skills many web developers include in their resumes.

Below you'll find links to some vast and recommended Treehouse courses and practice sessions. They explore what jQuery is, why you'd want to use it, how to include it in your projects, and the fundamentals of using it to manipulate elements on a web page and respond to user interactions.

# How Does JavaScript Code Run?
In this video, you'll learn more about what type of language JavaScript is, and how JavaScript code runs in the browser and other environments.
- You can manipulate almost everything at runtime with JavaScript

### Resources
- **[Dynamic programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language):** a language that executes at runtime (the period of time in which the program runs). You write a series of sections that tell program what to do. JavaScript is a dynamic programming language.
    - create new variables, change the underlying type of a variable, create new functions, redefine existing functions, load new scripts, and more.
    - Different runtime environments for JS:
        - Web Browser that have a built-in Interpreter that reads, understands, and compiles the program.

- **[JavaScript engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine):** its goal is to parse and execute JS code. Converts it to fast optimized code that a browser can understand. Browsers have a built-in JIT (just in time compiler) - turns JS code into machine code so JS can run faster by monitoring the code as it runs (this is called "runtime compilation").
    - **Every browswer has its own implementation of a JS engine**
    - SpiderMonkey powers Firefox - the first JS engine that powered Netscape Navigator and now powers Firefox today
    - Chakra powers IE and Edge
    - V8 powers Chrome - it's a powerful open source JavaScript engine

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/):** this is a non-browser environment to run JS code.
    - Despite the browser, Node.js is anohter common JS runtime environment.

# What Text Editors Do JavaScript Developers Use?
When building a JavaScript project, it all starts with the text editor. There are many JavaScript-friendly text editors available. In this video, we'll explore popular text editors that help make you a more efficient coder.

To handle the increased complexity of coding, developers turn to tools to help them be more efficient.

### Text editors - where you spend most of your time; should make you a more efficient coder and handle JS needs (i.e. Syntax Highlighting, Proper Indentation, Code Completion)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Atom and Visual Studio Code were built using JavaScript, with the [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) framework

^ These are fast, lightweight, and powerful text editors that have features like:
- Syntax highlighting
- automatic code completion
- easy themeable, customizable and extensible
- built-in package managers to install tools with additional features

### Linters - reads your code to help you avoid problems, check style consistency, and spot possible errors
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [What is the difference between Prettier and ESLint?](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/2364)

### Code Formatters - enforce a consistent style (i.e. tabs vs. spaces, semicolons vs. no semicolons, etc.)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [How does Prettier compare to ESLint?](https://prettier.io/docs/en/comparison.html)



# JavaScript Build Tools
When starting a new JavaScript project, developers usually set up a **build system** using tools that help manage all of the moving parts of the project, and just about everything needed to build and run their application.
- For more advanced applications, developers use build systems to automate their workflow, increase efficiency, and build projects faster.

### A JavaScript developer's build system usually includes:
- **Package managers:** Many JavaScript applications rely on external dependencies like libraries, frameworks and other time-saving tools, which help developers avoid having to rewrite their own solutions to common problems. Libraries, frameworks and other software are created and shared by the JavaScript community and brought into a project using a [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager). A project could have tens or hundreds of external dependencies, and in many cases, some dependencies rely on other installed dependencies. Package managers install and keep track of all the dependencies of a project. They also simplify the process of upgrading, configuring and removing dependencies. The most popular JavaScript package manager is [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (node package manager). Another commonly used package manager is [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), which was created by Facebook.

- **Module bundlers:** Since JavaScript applications often use frameworks, libraries and other external dependencies, the JavaScript source code is usually split between a number of files or modules. Module bundlers combine all of your source code (and all of its dependencies) into a single, [minified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) JavaScript file before it's served to the browser. Module bundlers commonly used today in JavaScript development are [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) is also a new open source JavaScript module bundler that recently launched.


- **Compilers:** Javascript runtime environments (like the browser) only understand standard JavaScript. Modern, complex JavaScript applications often require more than pure JavaScript. For instance, you may want to take advantage of new, cutting-edge JavaScript features that are not yet supported by all browsers. Or, you're using a library or framework that uses a special syntax that's not understood by browsers (like [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)). Earlier you learned that [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) are different "flavors" of JavaScript that do not run natively in the browser. If you try their code in the browser, you'll get all sorts of errors. Since these languages cannot be understood and ran by browsers, you need to transform them to standard JavaScript using a [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler). A compiler is a tool that translates source code written using a special type of syntax into code that can work in the browser. Typescript, for instance, has a built-in compiler that converts a TypeScript file to plain JavaScript. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is the most popular JavaScript compiler used by developers, and it's the most reliable way to use features from ES2015 and beyond while supporting older browsers.

- **Task runners:** JavaScript programming is challenging enough. The less work you have to do when performing repetitive tasks, the easier your job becomes. Task runners define and run common tasks in your project. Anything you might do manually over and over again could be automated and handed off to a task runner. For example:
    - Minifying your JavaScript so it can be loaded quickly and efficiently into the browser
    - Running tests on your code
    - Starting up a development server on your computer to run your app
    - Automatically reloading the browser for you whenever a JavaScript file is saved
    - Compiling source code from one type of syntax to another
[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) is a common task runner, and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (the node package manager) can also run automated tasks and is now the preferred task runner of many developers.

JavaScript tools change quickly. Be sure to check this page frequently (and [the state of JS build tools](https://2017.stateofjs.com/2017/build-tools/results) for up-to-date information.

- **Command Line:** gives you control over the functionality of a computer, that way you can install and run packages, libraries, and build tools quickly and efficiently.

# A JavaScript Developer's Workflow
We'll talk about common JavaScript development workflows, as well as frameworks, libraries and other tools developers use in their day-to-day work.

Usual Process:
- build a project
- code and reload approach to dev: write a small amount...reload in browser to test 
- inspect browser console for errors
- repeat until project is finished (don't need a compiler or build tool)

For More Complex Processes:
- set up a build system to automate your workflow and install a JavaScript library or framework to increase efficiency and build projects faster.


### JavaScript libraries and frameworks
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): developed by Facebook and is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries / front-end frameworks. Creates an easy way for you to break up the user interface into manageable, usable chunks.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/): another common framework; many similarities to React
- [Angular](https://angular.io/): maintained by Google - complete JS framework with more built-in functionality. 

### CLIs: command line interface - makes it easier to create an app without configuring any tools. Already come with a build system that includes the tools you need to get started (i.e. webpack, rollup, Babel compiler, etc.)
- [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Vue CLI](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/installation.html#CLI)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)

### Debugging JavaScript - detecting/fixing errors quickly
- [Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/) - helps you find/fix problems fast
    - `npm test` = for running test scripts
    - `npm build` = for creating a production ready build and deploy the project live to a server
